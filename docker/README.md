## What is Docker?

Docker is an open source platform that enables the building and management of containers. It is a platform as a service platform, as it provides an OS-level virtualisation. 

It is linked to a global repository known as Docker Hub. Docker images can be stored in repositories on Docker Hub. A Docker image is a file used to build a specifically configured container. 

## What is a Dockerfile?

It is a text document that contains all the commands, that a user can typically input into the command line, to build an image. To build the image detailed in a Dockerfile, the path of the Dockerfile has to be specified.
