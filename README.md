# Microservices Architecture

## What is Microservices Architecture?

It is a type of software architecture in which the software product is composed of small independent services that are able to communicate over well-defined APIs. Each service focus on an individual problem, so the code of one service doesn't need to be shared with another; making the application decoupled. Typically, each service will be allocated its own dedicated team.

### What are the Benefits?

- Easier deployment- as a consequence of each service being developed and tested by cross-functional teams, the troubleshooting of that service is more efficient
- Flexible scaling- adding or taking away functionality from the overall application is a much simpler process, as it equated to adding or taking away a service
- Application resilience- the application is not dependent on all of its components to run; the application is decentralised
